Details: {'tool_to_call': 'execute_commands_sequentially', 'commands_list': [{'command': 'this_command_will_fail_for_pruning_test', 'working_directory': '.', 'expected_outcome_description': 'Command fails, task pruned.'}], 'rth_config': {'rth_script_path': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Man\\\\CursorAgentUtils\\\\robust_terminal_handler.py', 'python_exe_for_rth': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Man\\\\AutoAgent\\\\.venv\\\\Scripts\\\\python.exe'}, 'per_command_rth_outputs_base_dir': 'instructions\\prune-test-cmd-001\\rth_outputs', 'instructions': "Execute the list of commands sequentially using robust_terminal_handler.py (RTH). RTH script path and Python executable are provided in 'rth_config'. For each command: 1. Construct the RTH invocation string (ensure paths and arguments are correctly quoted/split). 2. Create a unique subdirectory (e.g., cmd_0, cmd_1) under 'per_command_rth_outputs_base_dir' for this command's RTH status, stdout, and stderr files. 3. Launch RTH, ensuring its --status-file-path points into this unique subdirectory. Also set --cwd if specified in the command item. 4. Poll for the RTH status file. 5. On completion/timeout, read the RTH status, stdout, and stderr. 6. Log these outputs clearly. 7. Clean up the RTH status, stdout, and stderr files for that command. If any command fails (RTH reports error, timeout, or non-zero subprocess exit code), stop executing further commands and report the overall operation as failed, including details of the failing command. If all commands execute successfully, report overall success. The agent is responsible for all aspects of RTH interaction."}
